# WASI P2 config - advanced features not covered by standard WASI interfaces
# Format: directive: value
#
# Available directives:
#   m: <path>     - Bind mount from /mnt/wasi0/<path> to /<path>
#   n: <mac>      - Enable networking with optional MAC address
#   b: <addr>     - External bundle address (9p=host:port)
#
# Note: These features are handled automatically by WASI standard interfaces:
#   - args, entrypoint, env: via wasi:cli (pass with: wasmtime run out.wasm -- /bin/sh)
#   - timestamp: auto-synced from host via wasi:clocks/wall-clock
#
# Default: no mounts, no networking (standalone container)
